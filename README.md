# maps_searching_neash

This Python script uses Selenium in headless mode to search for businesses across various niches in a specified country on Google Maps. It retrieves key details such as company name, address, location coordinates, and contact information. The results are then saved into a CSV file.

**Prerequisites**
1. Ensure geckodriver is present in the same directory as the run.py file for the Firefox WebDriver.
2. Before running the script, install the latest versions of Python, Selenium, setuptools, and geckodriver.
